      <p id = "hey_p">Hey there! I'm Tianny (pronounced tee-AWN-knee), an Information Science student focusing on data analysis and user experience. I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, and currently attending my final year at the University of Michigan's School of Information.</p>

      <p id = "dance_p">Growing up, I spent most of my days in a dance studio, at dance competitions, or at a theater performing (you guessed it!) dance recitals. Ballet, contemporary, and modern were my creative outlets where I was able to open my mind, experiment with new possibilities, and challenge myself. Coming to college, I was looking for a new outlet where I can creatively express and share, so I took an "Intro to Python" course (seems about right?). From that point on, the word “creativity” evolved and began to take on different forms and shapes with whatever I found myself doing--whether that was exploring data visualization with satellite imagery at Planet, making my own posters in my graphic design course, or diving into what on-demand delivery means at Postmates. I have a passion for technology and hope to pair my studies in data analytics with an ever-evolving creative mindset, combining that with user advocacy, to create products that empower people reach their goals.</p>

      <p id = "facts_p">A few random facts about me: I love trying new cuisines and foods. I have a labradoodle named Cooper who loves to eat watermelon and carrots. I’ve been a Warriors fan my entire life (thanks to my brother). I also love helping others and have joined some pretty cool organizations in college like <a href="https://www.optimizemi.org">optiMize</a> and <a href="https://www.campkesem.org/find-a-camp/camp-kesem-at-the-university-of-michigan">Camp Kesem</a>! So that's just a brief introduction to me. I'm just getting started and I can't wait to explore where this all takes me. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
